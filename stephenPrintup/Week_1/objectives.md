### Skills
You should be able to:

[]* Work confidently in the console of at least one browser and in the node REPL.

[X]* Declare and initialize variables, and use assignment and incremental assignment operators to modify them.

[]* Articulate branching conditions both with and without boolean operators.

[]* Use short-circuit boolean operators in conditional evaluation.

[]* Anticipate the behavior of special Numbers (_NaN, Infinity_), non-integer numbers, and non-numbers in computations.

[X]* Use common mathematical functions from the Math and Number objects.

[]* Manipulate variables to represent and solve simple arithmetic and geometric problems.

[]* Parse any expression, deconstructing it into a tree of constituent expressions and tracing their evaluation in the correct order.

[]* Notice all operators with side-effects and track any changes in the value of variables.

[]* Predict the exact result of any expression whose constituent values are known.

[]* Reason about the possible behavior of expressions which contain some unknown values.

[X]* Trace on paper the execution of simple programs.
