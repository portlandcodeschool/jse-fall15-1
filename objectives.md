_cd, ls, pwd, cp, mv, mkdir, rm, rmdir,
sudo, chmod, chown, ps, top, man, which,
history, more, less, head, tail, env, $PATH,
node, vim, emacs, git_

_local repo, remote repo, working directory,
origin, clone, branch, status,
checkout, add, remove, commit, staged, untracked,
merge, push, pull_


### Skills

* Commit a set of changes
* Pull master from origin
* Push a branch to origin
* Make a pull request

## Javascript

### Jargon

You should understand the meaning and behavior of the following:

* Operators:

```
+ _(numeric and string)_
- / * %
== === != !== < > <= >=
= += -= /= *= %=
++X --X X++ X--
! && ||
X?Y:Z
typeof
```

* Statements and keywords:

```
var
if () {...}
if () {...} else {...}
```

* Special primitives:

```
true
false
undefined
''
NaN
Infinity
```

* Vocabulary:

_infix, prefix, postfix, unary, binary, ternary,
evaluation, operator, operand, type,
number, integer, float, string, numeric string,
string literal, concatenation, interpolation,
boolean, expression, statement, primitive,
auto-conversion, type coercion, parsing, precedence,
declare, initialize, keyword, REPL, mod,
conditional, condition, consequent, block, short-circuit, truthy/truish, falsey/falsish_

### Skills
You should be able to:

* Work confidently in the console of at least one browser and in the node REPL.

* Declare and initialize variables, and use assignment and incremental assignment operators to modify them.

* Articulate branching conditions both with and without boolean operators.

* Use short-circuit boolean operators in conditional evaluation.

* Anticipate the behavior of special Numbers (_NaN, Infinity_), non-integer numbers, and non-numbers in computations.

* Use common mathematical functions from the Math and Number objects.

* Manipulate variables to represent and solve simple arithmetic and geometric problems.

* Parse any expression, deconstructing it into a tree of constituent expressions and tracing their evaluation in the correct order.

* Notice all operators with side-effects and track any changes in the value of variables.

* Predict the exact result of any expression whose constituent values are known.

* Reason about the possible behavior of expressions which contain some unknown values.
